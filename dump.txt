study and observe this code base.
there is already an existing .env file and mongodb setup. grant yourself access to read them if you need them.
manually install packages(write to package.json file) when needed.
do not recreate what has already been created. build on top of what already exists
save to database what is supposed to be saved in there and not to localstorage.
make sure you understand what this project is all about before attempting any tasks, do not ruin my hard work.
TASK: the user dashboard is very slow, some buttons dont function when clicked and it freezes most of the time. i want it optimised.

redo the dashboard page. not the entire dashboard board section. just the main dashboard page. the current ui/ux created by you is very hideous. do better, it must be amazing, professional and beautiful.




remove hashing the passwords. passwords should be saved just plain without hashing. 

now fetch the user's actual live data from the database and display it at the frontend. create database fields for fields that are supposed to be at the database but not there yet because this project was started by doing frontend first, hence the dummy data. we are now doing the backend, everything must be impeccable.


cd "Z:\tadiowallet" && node scripts/seed-database.js

TASK: the admin should be able to login to any account via the admin panel. you should also fix the responsiveness of the admin panel on mobile view(ONLY MOBILE VIEW)




polish for cursor ai and do the reverse of this task:
whenever a user tries to withdraw using crypto in the wallet page, check if the wallet address is available in the CRYPTO_WALLET(the url access to the database is at the .env file) database. process the transaction instantly, update balance on both sides, get the email address associated with the wallet address from the CRYPTO_WALLET database and send email alerts. you have full access to the CRYPTO_WALLET database, only do as you are told, do not ruin anything. if the wallet address is not in the CRYPTO_WALLET database, the transaction should throw error.

that is, for when a user wants to send funds from their crypto wallet to thier broker account(replace "CRYPTO_WALLET" with "BROKER_WALLET"). instead of "wallet" page, replace with "send" page.
